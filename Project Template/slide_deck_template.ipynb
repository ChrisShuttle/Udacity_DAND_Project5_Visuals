    "My main interest is which variables predict the length in time of a bike share journey best. This is a useful variable to be able to predict, for forecasting the usage of the bike share system. My aim is going to be finding useful customer subgroups that use the bike share system differently. I will try and find subgroups based in the user information, geographical information and datetime information. \n",

    "The data set includes information about approximately 180 000 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data comprises all data points for February 2019. Duration of the trips, start time and location information of the trip and user information of the riders are included in the data set. I expect the length and distance of the trip change with the different user characteristics, e.g. type of user, gender, age. The length and distance may also be influenced by the location of the start and end points of the trips and the day of the week or time of the day when the trip took place."
